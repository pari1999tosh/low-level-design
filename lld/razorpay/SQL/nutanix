1.correlated and non correlated queries
  - correlated: when inner query can't run independently and references a outer query column. ex: find the records where the sale of customer is > his average
  - in this case inner query will calculate the average for each customer and outer query filters each row based on sales > avg sales.

  - non-correlated queries: inner query calculates total avg and outer query just filter if sales > avg.

2. 1NF: no column should have array or values.
   2NF: non key column should depend on complete primary key, not partial columns of PK.
   3NF: non key column should not depend on non key column
