  User should be able to add expense which could be divided equally.
  Expose a function to get all the expense added by user.
  Expose a function to get balance of a user [this should give final balance of user and simplified balance with each user].
  Expose a function to get all the expense where the user is part of.
  For interview we need only equal split to be implemented but solution should be extensible for other type of expense like unequal split or percentage split.
