functional requirement:
 - upload file
 - download file
 - sync file across devices, 

out of scope:
 - don't design blob storage, use s3- that's a seperate question.

non functional:
 - availability
 - consistency
 - availability > consistency , main purpose of such sevrices is to add arhcitecture diagram, database diagram etc.
 - low latency uploads and downloads(as low as possible)
 - support large file uploads like 50gb.
 - resume upload functionality should be there.
 - High data integrity.it's okay if syncing takes some time, but after syncing it should be accurate.
