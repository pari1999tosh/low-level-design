User enters a URL in the browser.
DNS resolution happens → domain is resolved to an IP, often pointing to the nearest CDN edge server.
TCP + TLS handshake establishes a secure connection (for HTTPS).
Browser requests the resource:
Static assets (images, CSS, JS, videos) → CDN checks cache at the nearest edge location.
If cached → served directly from edge (fast).
If not cached → CDN fetches from origin, stores it, then serves it.
Dynamic HTML → usually fetched from the origin server (unless explicitly cached by the CDN, e.g., for static sites).
Response delivered → browser parses HTML, downloads other assets (mostly from CDN), builds DOM/CSSOM, executes JS, and renders the page.
