what is performance?
1.measure of how fast the system is if we keep below paremeter constants:
 1. workload.
     -> amount of backend data
     ->Request volume.
 2.Hardware assigned to system:
   RAM
   CPU
   Memory

Goal is to design a system whose:
->performace does not severely degrade when workload is increases.
->performance should increase if we give superior hardware.
