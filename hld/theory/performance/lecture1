what is performance?
1.measure of how fast the system is if we keep below paremeter constants:
 1. workload.
     -> amount of backend data
     ->Request volume.
 2.Hardware assigned to system:
   RAM
   CPU
   Memory

Goal is to design a system whose:
->performace does not severely degrade when workload is increases.
->performance should increase if we give superior hardware.

how performance problems occur?
->when the rate of feeding the request to a system is more than the rate of consumption, these requests are queued up somewhere.
  reaspns:
  ->inefficient code.
  -> serial code execution, ex synchronised keyword in java which allows one thread at a time.
  -> limited resource capacity.even if u have the capability to execute multiple requests paralelly, but you don't have lot of CPUs.(have the capability to build multiple road
      but you don't have land space)

principles to ensure high performace:
1. Efficiency.
2. Concurrency
3. capcity

there are single request processing and concurrent request processing.

Efficiency: how efficient a single request is proceesed by system.(suppose you have a CPU which has enough capacity to process this request), 
            does our algorithm utilises these resources efficiently.
            DB queries should be utilising as less resources as possible.
            DB design should be efficient, use of proper data structures.(indexing etc)
            resources efficiently.

Concurrency: how efficiently the operating system process multiple request present in the system at same time.
             when one request occupied all resources, other request won't get it and quieing will happeb

Latency vs throughput:
Latency: wait time + process time of a request.
throughput: how many request the system can process in a given time.
if latency is less, throughput will be more.

tail latency is an indication of queuing in system, 

minimizing network latency:
1. using connection pool.
2. use persistent connection, browser by default use persistent connection. for interservice communication if u do a call using
   axios, u need to specify the connection:keep-alive because internally axios uses https library of node.js which by default doesn't
   use persistent connections.
3. for intraservuce communication use, grpc(binary protocol) protocol instead of https(ASCII transfer).
4. compress the data which needs to be transferred, it can significantly reduce data transfer latency.

Memory access latency:
 1. every process in the app requires some memory, when the memeory is about to go out of bound, garbage collectors run very aggressively,
    this leads to lot of latency because GC algorithms blocks all the threads to clean up memory.
